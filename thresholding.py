thresholding.py

This module provides functions for image thresholding using OpenCV and NumPy.
It includes basic global thresholding, automatic (Otsu's) thresholding, adaptive thresholding,
and vertical adaptive Otsu thresholding. All functions operate on NumPy image arrays and return
the thresholded (binary) image.
